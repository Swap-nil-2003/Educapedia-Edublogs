         <p class="font1">In today’s world, at least when it comes to employment and jobs, no one understands anything except degrees and GOOD institutions. This word ‘GOOD’ has no amount of ‘GOODNESS’ left in it for us anymore. Thus, for a better and brighter future for all of us, jobs should be delinked from degrees.
           In the 21st century, education has become more concerned with degrees and not its effectiveness or need in our lives. People now consider an extreme high level of ‘literacy’ as education. The knowledge acquired in schools and educational institutes are not much useful to us in our practical lives. Sometimes we do not get deserving recognition for their knowledge we have because of some not-so-effective examination papers. A person’s eligibility for a job/work should be based on their skills and not a scrap of paper called ‘DEGREE’.</p> 
        <p class="font1">Marks and degree can never be an accurate measurement for are learning, intelligence and skills.  Marks in an exam for a particular subject in academics can be obtained even by mugging up textbooks and reference books and putting a xerox copy of them in the answer scripts. This in no way has any relation with learning and understanding of that subject. Moreover, our degrees mention only the academic details of a student but never about their extracurricular participation, the behavioral and personality traits or the uniqueness and goodness within them as a human. In this way the strengths of the student go unrecognized.
            In many countries follow, including India, due to poverty, domestic violence and other such issues, children try to get a job of an average salary as soon as they can and so, they skip high school to get into college as they need the degree for that job. The young students use unscrupulous methods to get over there, in a fair or a foul manner. This drastically leads to a decline in quality learning.
            If degree and jobs get delinked from each other, then a great amount of pressure and politics would be removed from the heads of students. Moreover, education and learning might also regain its quality. Students would be more focused on trying to understand learn and even ‘feel’ their subjects then cramming and somehow getting a degree. If they receive such quality learning, the application and execution of their knowledge and skills would improve, which would be a boon to the respective companies the students and thus the society.</p>
